# a1-beep

Play a beep sound on the computer.

## Why

Beep is usually a `\u07` character printed to console. Unfortunately, on modern computers beeping is disabled.

## Usage

Pre-requisite: Make sure that the `play` command is installed. (Note, a list of other common players will be added in the future).

Then, simply write:

```javascript
require('a1-beep').beep()
```
